# ChatBot_ProductSearch

## Chatbot Project Scope Document
### Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that interacts with users to search for products on various e-commerce websites (Amazon, Flipkart, eBay). The chatbot will present the search results in a tabular format, including relevant details such as product name, price, rating, link to buy, and review comments.

### Objectives:
#### User Interaction:

Implement a user-friendly interface that prompts users to enter the product they want to search for.
Handle user inputs effectively, providing a seamless experience.

#### Web Scraping:

Develop web scraping functionality for Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay.
Extract essential product information, including Product Name, Price, Rating, Link to Buy, and Review Comments.

#### Data Processing:

Define a consistent data structure for storing product information.
Implement data processing and cleaning to handle inconsistencies and unexpected data.

#### Data Storage:

Choose an appropriate data storage solution (e.g., CSV, SQLite) for storing scraped data.
Implement functions to store scraped data in the chosen format.

#### Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Create a command-line interface for user interaction.
Integrate web scraping functionality into the CLI.
Display search results in a tabular format.

#### User Experience Enhancement:

Implement tabular output using a library like tabulate for better readability.
Enhance the chatbot's handling of different user inputs.
Add error handling for invalid inputs.

#### Refinement and Testing:

Review and refine code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
Conduct thorough testing with various search queries and websites.
Address and fix any bugs or issues identified during testing.

### Documentation:

Document the code with comments and explanations for future reference.
Create a simple user guide explaining how to use the chatbot.
### Finalization:

Ensure all code is clean, well-documented, and functional.
Package the project for easy deployment if needed.
Deliverables:
Fully functional chatbot with web scraping capabilities for Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay.
Codebase with clear documentation and comments.
User guide for operating the chatbot.
Constraints:
The project will focus on a command-line interface for simplicity.
Web scraping should comply with the terms of service of each e-commerce website.
The chatbot will be developed in Python using libraries such as BeautifulSoup and tabulate.
Assumptions:
The structure of the e-commerce websites will remain consistent during the development period.
Users will have a basic understanding of using a command-line interface
